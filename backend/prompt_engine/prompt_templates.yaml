swagger_to_postman: |
  You are a QA Automation Assistant. Your job is to create a Postman-compatible test suite
  for the given Swagger (OpenAPI) specification.

  🧾 Instruction:
  - Read the full Swagger spec below
  - Generate a structured Postman collection in JSON format
  - Cover the following test cases for **each endpoint**:
    1. ✅ Happy path test with valid inputs
    2. ❌ Negative test: required field missing
    3. ❌ Invalid field value (e.g., string instead of number)
    4. 🔁 Edge case based on parameter min/max, length, format, etc.
    5. 🔐 Unauthorized access (if security is defined)
    6. ⚠️ Business logic errors (e.g., 422 from wrong combinations)

  🧠 Swagger (OpenAPI) Spec:
  {{ swagger_spec }}

  Return only a valid Postman v2 collection JSON.

---

single_endpoint_test: |
  You are an API testing expert. Based on the Swagger documentation provided for a single endpoint,
  generate exhaustive test cases in Postman JSON format.

  📌 Test Coverage Checklist:
  - Happy path
  - Missing parameter(s)
  - Invalid parameter type or value
  - Boundary value analysis
  - Auth errors (401/403 if applicable)
  - Server errors (500 handling)
  - Optional: Performance mock (simulate 429 or timeout)

  📍 Endpoint Spec:
  {{ endpoint_spec }}

multi_test_generation: |
  You are an LLM-based test scenario generator. Given a list of endpoint definitions and example request/response bodies,
  output the **test case list only** — do not generate Postman JSON yet.

  📊 Expected Output Format:
  - Method: <GET|POST|PUT|DELETE>
  - Path: /api/v1/resource
  - Scenarios:
      - "Valid resource creation"
      - "Missing required header"
      - "User not authorized"
      - "Input exceeds length limit"
      - "Unsupported media type"
      - "Malformed request body"

  📦 Input:
  {{ endpoint_list_block }}

---

postman_learning_context: |
  You are a test strategy assistant. Analyze the existing Postman collection and extract:
  1. Folder and subfolder structure
  2. Types of assertions written (e.g., status code, body value, schema match)
  3. Repetition patterns (e.g., common pre-request scripts, environment usage)
  4. Parameterization (e.g., variables, collection runners)
  5. Custom scripts (e.g., JavaScript inside test blocks)

  📄 Postman Collection Input:
  {{ postman_json }}

---

swagger_section_summary: |
  Summarize the following Swagger (OpenAPI) block for ingestion by an LLM agent.
  Output must include:
  - Endpoint path and method(s)
  - Query, path, and body parameters with types
  - Response codes and their meaning
  - Security or auth flags

  This output will be used as memory context for generation.

  📍 Swagger Block:
  {{ swagger_sub_block }}

rephrased_prompt_for_tr_api: |
  You are an Anthropic Claude-compatible assistant operating behind an internal corporate API.
  Follow the instruction and use the provided context to output the correct Postman tests.

  ⚙️ Settings:
  - Tokens: up to 128,000
  - Temperature: 0.1
  - Top_p: 0.9
  - System prompt enabled

  📝 Task:
  {{ instruction }}

  📦 Context:
  {{ context_block }}

error_case_enumeration: |
  You are an API contract analyzer. Your task is to read a Swagger endpoint definition and enumerate
  all potential test cases where the API could respond with error codes such as 400, 401, 403, 422, 500.

  For each error code, include:
  - Cause or trigger condition
  - Whether it's a client or server side issue
  - Parameters involved (if any)
  - Suggested test scenario name

  📍 Endpoint:
  {{ endpoint_block }}

---

performance_test_hints: |
  Suggest 3–5 performance or stress test scenarios based on the API definition.
  Consider:
    - Rate limiting
    - Throttling
    - Pagination
    - Query size
    - Parallel request issues

  ⚙️ Input:
  {{ performance_block }}
